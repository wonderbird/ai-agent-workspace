# AI Agent Workspace

This folder is a workspace. It contains all projects I develop with the help of AI agents as git submodules. This workspace corresponds to the `Cline` folder explained in (1).

The [Rules](./Rules/) folder contains general rules all coding agents MUST consider.

If a coding agent is reading this README.md, it MUST process the file [Rules/10-setup.md](./Rules/10-setup.md) next.
