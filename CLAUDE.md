## LS tool does not show hidden files

When you want to check whether a hidden file or directory exists, then you MUST use a tool native to the operating system you are running on. The LS tool does not handle hidden files.

## Read the Rules

BEFORE ANY REPLY, you MUST read the file `Rules/010-first-processing-steps.md` and follow ALL contained instructions.
