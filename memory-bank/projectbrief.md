# AI Agent Rule Reliability Improvement Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the reliability of AI agent rules defined in the parent workspace Rules directory. The Rules folder serves as a centralized rule system applicable to all projects within the AI Agent Workspace.

## Core Problem

AI agents exhibit rule degradation over extended sessions, particularly forgetting critical rules during implementation and commit phases. This leads to:
- Forgotten TDD principles during implementation
- Missing commit message formatting and co-author trailers
- Neglected memory bank updates before commits
- Content duplication across memory bank files
- Creation of unauthorized files outside memory bank specification

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Eliminate rule degradation over session duration
2. **Secondary Goal**: Improve memory bank structure compliance
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Reduce manual review overhead for Stefan

## Success Criteria

- AI agents maintain rule compliance throughout entire sessions
- Zero content duplication in memory bank files
- No unauthorized file creation outside memory bank specification
- Automatic memory bank updates before commits
- Reduced manual review and correction effort

## Constraints

- Individual developer focus (solo developer implementation)
- No team coordination required
- Self-contained solutions
- Minimal external infrastructure dependencies
- Personal customization capabilities

## Project Scope

This increment focuses on creating a memory bank and analyzing solution approaches for rule reliability improvement. Future increments will implement the chosen solution approach.
