# AI Agent Rule Reliability Improvement Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the reliability of AI agent rules defined in the parent workspace Rules directory. The Rules folder serves as a centralized rule system applicable to all projects within the AI Agent Workspace.

## Core Problem

AI agents exhibit rule degradation over extended sessions, particularly forgetting critical rules during implementation and commit phases. This leads to:
- Forgotten TDD principles during implementation
- Missing commit message formatting and co-author trailers
- Neglected memory bank updates before commits
- Content duplication across memory bank files
- Creation of unauthorized files outside memory bank specification

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Eliminate rule degradation over session duration
2. **Secondary Goal**: Improve memory bank structure compliance
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Reduce manual review overhead for Stefan

## Success Criteria

- AI agents maintain rule compliance throughout entire sessions
- Zero content duplication in memory bank files
- No unauthorized file creation outside memory bank specification
- Automatic memory bank updates before commits
- Reduced manual review and correction effort

## Constraints

- Individual developer focus (solo developer implementation)
- No team coordination required
- Self-contained solutions
- Minimal external infrastructure dependencies
- Personal customization capabilities

## Project Scope

This increment focuses on formalizing the decision-making process for the AI rule adherence problem. It culminates in the creation of an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that outlines the context, drivers, and potential solutions. Future increments will implement the chosen solution approach.
