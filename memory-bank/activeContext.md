# Active Context: Implementation Planning

## Current Work Focus

**Session Goal**: To plan and execute the migration to Cursor IDE as the chosen solution for AI agent rule reliability. The decision has been made and documented in the ADR - now focus shifts to implementation.

## Recent Changes

### Completed in Previous Session
1.  **Decision Finalized**: Cursor IDE was selected as the solution approach after comprehensive analysis.
2.  **ADR Updated**: The Architectural Decision Record was updated with the final decision, rationale, and consequences.
3.  **Rule Refinements**: Minor improvements to persona language and git usage rules were made.
4.  **Tool Enhancement**: Clone script was updated to automatically create AGENTS.md files.

### Key Insights Discovered
- Cursor IDE's "always apply" rules feature directly addresses the core problem of rule degradation.
- Commercial off-the-shelf solutions can provide rapid implementation with low maintenance overhead.
- The decision process validated the importance of rapid implementation and minimal disruption criteria.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1.  **Cursor IDE Setup**: Install and configure Cursor IDE with existing rules.
2.  **Rule Migration**: Transfer current rules from Rules/ directory to Cursor's rules system.
3.  **Workflow Testing**: Test the new setup with actual development tasks.
4.  **Documentation Update**: Update memory bank to reflect new implementation approach.

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1.  Complete Cursor IDE migration and configuration.
2.  Validate rule enforcement effectiveness in real development scenarios.
3.  Measure improvement in rule compliance and developer experience.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Decision 1: Cursor IDE Migration Strategy
- **Approach**: Gradual migration starting with rule transfer, then workflow adaptation.
- **Priority**: Ensure rule content is properly formatted for Cursor's system.
- **Status**: Ready to begin implementation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Stefan's Preferences
- **Rapid Implementation**: Prefers solutions that can be implemented in under two weeks.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Solutions must not block or interrupt the development workflow.
- **Low Maintenance**: Prefers a "set it and forget it" approach with minimal need for ongoing tuning.

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Process Learnings
- **ADR Value**: Using ADRs provides structure and clarity for critical decisions, ensuring they are well-documented and transparent.
