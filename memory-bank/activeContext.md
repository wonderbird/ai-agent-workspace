# Active Context: Decision Making

## Current Work Focus

**Session Goal**: To make a final, well-informed decision on the architectural strategy for the AI agent rule reliability problem. The primary artifact for this decision is the completed and polished Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

## Recent Changes

### Completed in This Session
1.  **ADR Finalized**: The initial ADR draft was significantly enhanced with additional alternatives, mitigation strategies for all options, and a clearer structure.
2.  **Decision Drivers Prioritized**: A stakeholder interview was conducted to confirm and prioritize the key decision drivers.
3.  **ADR Restructured for Readability**: The document was iteratively refactored to separate the executive summary from the detailed analysis, making it more accessible to new readers.
4.  **ADR Polished**: A final review was conducted to add an executive summary, a glossary, and improved navigation, resulting in a complete and polished document.

### Key Insights Discovered
- Iterative refinement is a powerful technique for improving the quality and clarity of architectural documents.
- Moving detailed information into an appendix significantly improves the readability of the main document body.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1.  **Review Final ADR**: Stefan to review the completed ADR.
2.  **Make Decision**: Based on the ADR, select the solution approach to implement.
3.  **Update ADR with Decision**: The chosen option, rationale, and consequences must be documented in the ADR.
4.  **Implementation Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan for the chosen solution.

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1.  Develop and deploy the MVP of the chosen solution.
2.  Begin measuring its effectiveness against the defined success criteria.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Decision 1: Solution Approach Selection
- **Options**: The five solution approaches are documented in the ADR.
- **Criteria**: The decision will be based on Rapid Implementation, Minimal Disruption, and Low Maintenance.
- **Status**: Formalized in ADR, awaiting decision.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Stefan's Preferences
- **Rapid Implementation**: Prefers solutions that can be implemented in under two weeks.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Solutions must not block or interrupt the development workflow.
- **Low Maintenance**: Prefers a "set it and forget it" approach with minimal need for ongoing tuning.

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Process Learnings
- **ADR Value**: Using ADRs provides structure and clarity for critical decisions, ensuring they are well-documented and transparent.
