# Active Context: Architectural Decision Making

## Current Work Focus

**Session Goal**: Formalize the architectural decision for the AI agent rule reliability problem. This involves capturing all analysis, researched options, and clarified decision drivers into an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) to enable a well-informed decision.

## Recent Changes

### Completed in This Session
1.  **Decision Drivers Clarified**: Identified the top 3 decision criteria: Rapid Implementation, Minimal Workflow Disruption, and Low Maintenance Overhead.
2.  **Architectural Decision Record (ADR) Created**: Drafted and committed `docs/architecture-decisions/001-ai-rule-adherence-strategy.md`. This document formally captures the problem, options, and drivers.

### Key Insights Discovered
- A formal ADR process is a highly effective method for structuring complex technical decisions.
- Clarifying and prioritizing decision drivers is crucial for selecting the most appropriate solution.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1.  **Review ADR**: Stefan to review the created ADR.
2.  **Make Decision**: Based on the ADR, select the solution approach to implement.
3.  **Implementation Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan for the chosen solution.

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1.  Develop and deploy the MVP of the chosen solution.
2.  Begin measuring its effectiveness against the defined success criteria.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Decision 1: Solution Approach Selection
- **Options**: The five solution approaches are documented in the ADR.
- **Criteria**: The decision will be based on Rapid Implementation, Minimal Disruption, and Low Maintenance.
- **Status**: Formalized in ADR, awaiting decision.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Stefan's Preferences
- **Rapid Implementation**: Prefers solutions that can be implemented in under two weeks.
- **Minimal Disruption**: Solutions must not block or interrupt the development workflow.
- **Low Maintenance**: Prefers a "set it and forget it" approach with minimal need for ongoing tuning.

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Process Learnings
- **ADR Value**: Using ADRs provides structure and clarity for critical decisions, ensuring they are well-documented and transparent.
