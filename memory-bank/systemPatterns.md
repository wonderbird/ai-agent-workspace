# System Patterns: AI Agent Rule Reliability

## Architecture Overview

The rule reliability system follows a layered architecture with three main components:

1. **Rule Definition Layer**: Centralized Rules directory with structured rule files
2. **Enforcement Layer**: Automated mechanisms for rule compliance
3. **Memory Layer**: Persistent context management across sessions

## Key Design Patterns

### Rule Degradation Prevention Pattern
- **Problem**: AI agents forget rules over extended sessions
- **Solution**: Context-aware rule reinforcement with adaptive timing
- **Implementation**: Session length triggers + context analysis
- **Benefits**: Proactive prevention rather than reactive correction

### Memory Bank Structure Pattern
- **Problem**: Content duplication and unauthorized file creation
- **Solution**: Strict validation with semantic analysis
- **Implementation**: AI-powered content analysis + workflow integration
- **Benefits**: Intent-aware validation prevents structural violations

### Individual Developer Pattern
- **Problem**: Solutions designed for teams don't work for solo developers
- **Solution**: Self-contained, minimal infrastructure approach
- **Implementation**: Personal customization + no team coordination
- **Benefits**: Rapid implementation and maintenance

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Path 1: Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement
1. Monitor session length and context usage
2. Detect rule degradation patterns
3. Trigger rule refresh at optimal moments
4. Validate reinforcement effectiveness

### Path 2: Memory Bank Structure Enforcement
1. Analyze content semantics across files
2. Detect duplication patterns
3. Validate file hierarchy compliance
4. Enforce timing requirements

### Path 3: Workflow Integration
1. Embed compliance checks in natural workflow
2. Learn developer patterns and preferences
3. Adapt timing to individual behavior
4. Provide seamless user experience

## Component Relationships

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Individual Developer Focus
- **Rationale**: Stefan is the primary user, team coordination adds complexity
- **Impact**: Simpler implementation, faster delivery
- **Trade-offs**: No team knowledge sharing, individual maintenance

### Decision 2: Context-Aware Reinforcement
- **Rationale**: Based on observed effectiveness of rule re-reading
- **Impact**: Addresses core degradation problem
- **Trade-offs**: Requires sophisticated context monitoring

### Decision 3: Memory Bank Structure Validation
- **Rationale**: Prevents most painful problems (duplication, unauthorized files)
- **Impact**: Maintains system integrity
- **Trade-offs**: May limit flexibility for edge cases
