# System Patterns: AI Agent Rule Reliability

## Architecture Overview

The rule reliability system follows a layered architecture with three main components:

1. **Rule Definition Layer**: Cursor IDE's built-in rules system with "always apply" functionality
2. **Enforcement Layer**: Cursor IDE's automatic rule injection before every AI request
3. **Memory Layer**: Persistent context management across sessions via Cursor's native capabilities

## Key Design Patterns

### Cursor IDE Rule Enforcement Pattern
- **Problem**: AI agents forget rules over extended sessions
- **Solution**: Cursor IDE's "always apply" rules feature
- **Implementation**: Built-in rule injection before every AI request
- **Benefits**: Automatic, reliable rule enforcement without manual intervention

### Memory Bank Structure Pattern
- **Problem**: Content duplication and unauthorized file creation
- **Solution**: Strict validation with semantic analysis
- **Implementation**: AI-powered content analysis + workflow integration
- **Benefits**: Intent-aware validation prevents structural violations

### Individual Developer Pattern
- **Problem**: Solutions designed for teams don't work for solo developers
- **Solution**: Self-contained, minimal infrastructure approach
- **Implementation**: Personal customization + no team coordination
- **Benefits**: Rapid implementation and maintenance

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Path 1: Cursor IDE Migration
1. Install and configure Cursor IDE
2. Transfer existing rules to Cursor's rules system
3. Test rule enforcement with development tasks
4. Optimize rule content for Cursor's format

### Path 2: Rule Content Optimization
1. Adapt rule content for Cursor's context injection
2. Test rule effectiveness across different scenarios
3. Refine rules based on real-world usage
4. Document Cursor-specific patterns

### Path 3: Workflow Integration
1. Adapt development workflow to Cursor IDE
2. Leverage Cursor's VS Code compatibility
3. Integrate with existing git and memory bank processes
4. Validate seamless user experience

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Individual Developer Focus
- **Rationale**: Stefan is the primary user, team coordination adds complexity
- **Impact**: Simpler implementation, faster delivery
- **Trade-offs**: No team knowledge sharing, individual maintenance

### Decision 2: Cursor IDE Adoption
- **Rationale**: Commercial solution provides built-in rule enforcement with "always apply" feature
- **Impact**: Directly solves rule degradation problem with minimal implementation effort
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor lock-in for enforcement mechanism, requires IDE migration

### Decision 3: Memory Bank Structure Validation
- **Rationale**: Prevents most painful problems (duplication, unauthorized files)
- **Impact**: Maintains system integrity
- **Trade-offs**: May limit flexibility for edge cases
