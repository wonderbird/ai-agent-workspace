2. **User Feedback Integration**: Continuous validation of effectiveness
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when systems fail
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize resource usage and latency

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Decision 1: Individual Developer Focus
- **Initial**: Considered team-wide solutions
- **Evolution**: Realized Stefan is primary user, team coordination adds complexity
- **Current**: Self-contained, individual customization approach
- **Rationale**: Faster implementation, simpler maintenance

### Decision 2: Memory Bank Complexity
- **Initial**: Assumed complex memory bank system was beneficial
- **Evolution**: Discovered it may contribute to rule degradation
- **Current**: Simplified structure with strict validation
- **Rationale**: Reduce cognitive load, prevent duplication

### Decision 3: Solution Approach
- **Initial**: Considered comprehensive rule management overhaul
- **Evolution**: Focused on specific pain points (commits, memory bank)
- **Current**: Context-aware reinforcement + structure enforcement
- **Rationale**: Addresses root causes with proven effectiveness

### Decision 4: Implementation Strategy
- **Initial**: Planned comprehensive implementation
- **Evolution**: Recognized value of incremental approach
- **Current**: MVP first, then enhancement based on learnings
- **Rationale**: Risk mitigation, faster feedback, continuous improvement
