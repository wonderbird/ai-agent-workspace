# Progress: AI Agent Rule Reliability Project

## What Works

### Established Foundation
- **Complete Memory Bank Structure**: All 6 core files created with proper hierarchy.
- **Problem Analysis**: Comprehensive understanding of rule degradation issues.
- **Solution Research**: 8 solution approaches analyzed with mitigating measures.
- **Decision Framework**: Clear criteria for solution selection have been identified and prioritized.
- **Formal Decision Process**: Using a polished and well-structured ADR is an effective way to prepare for and document complex decisions.

### Proven Patterns
- **Iterative Refinement**: Iteratively restructuring and polishing a document significantly improves its readability and clarity.
- **Rule Re-reading Effectiveness**: Manual rule re-reading consistently improves compliance.
- **Context-Aware Triggers**: Session length and context usage predict degradation.
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Hierarchical file organization prevents duplication.
- **Individual Developer Focus**: Self-contained solutions work better than team coordination.

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Implementation (Next Session)
1. **Cursor IDE Installation**: Install and configure Cursor IDE.
2. **Rule Migration**: Transfer existing rules from Rules/ directory to Cursor's rules system.
3. **Workflow Testing**: Validate rule enforcement with actual development tasks.
4. **Documentation Update**: Update memory bank and project documentation.

### Short-term Development (1-2 weeks)
1. **Cursor IDE Migration**
   - Complete IDE setup and configuration
   - Rule system optimization for Cursor
   - Workflow adaptation and testing
   - Performance validation

2. **Rule Enforcement Validation**
   - Test rule compliance across different scenarios
   - Measure improvement in developer experience
   - Document lessons learned
   - Optimize rule content based on results

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
   - Update all project documentation
   - Create migration guide for future reference
   - Document Cursor-specific patterns and best practices

### Medium-term Goals (1-3 months)
1. **Enhanced Memory Architecture**
   - Three-tier memory system
   - Persistent rule awareness
   - Cross-session continuity
   - Privacy-compliant storage

2. **Intelligent Rule Validation Pipeline**
   - Multi-stage validation system
   - Context-aware checking
   - False positive reduction
   - Automated rule generation

## Known Issues

### Technical Challenges
1. **Context Window Limitations**: AI models have fixed context windows
2. **Session Memory**: No persistent memory across sessions
3. **Rule Complexity**: Multiple rules can overwhelm processing
4. **Validation Overhead**: Automated checks may slow workflow

### Implementation Risks
1. **Solution Complexity**: Sophisticated solutions may be over-engineered
2. **Workflow Disruption**: Automated enforcement may interrupt flow
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex systems require ongoing maintenance
4. **Individual Developer Burden**: Solutions may add complexity rather than reduce it

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Continuous validation of effectiveness
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when systems fail
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize resource usage and latency

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Decision 1: Individual Developer Focus
- **Initial**: Considered team-wide solutions
- **Evolution**: Realized Stefan is primary user, team coordination adds complexity
- **Current**: Self-contained, individual customization approach
- **Rationale**: Faster implementation, simpler maintenance

### Decision 2: Memory Bank Complexity
- **Initial**: Assumed complex memory bank system was beneficial
- **Evolution**: Discovered it may contribute to rule degradation
- **Current**: Simplified structure with strict validation
- **Rationale**: Reduce cognitive load, prevent duplication

### Decision 3: Solution Approach
- **Initial**: Considered comprehensive rule management overhaul
- **Evolution**: Focused on specific pain points (commits, memory bank)
- **Current**: Context-aware reinforcement + structure enforcement
- **Rationale**: Addresses root causes with proven effectiveness

### Decision 4: Implementation Strategy
- **Initial**: Planned comprehensive implementation
- **Evolution**: Recognized value of iterative approach for both the solution and the documentation (ADR).
- **Current**: MVP first, then enhancement based on learnings
- **Rationale**: Risk mitigation, faster feedback, continuous improvement
