# Product Context: AI Agent Rule Reliability System

## Product Vision

A reliable AI agent rule management system that maintains consistent rule compliance throughout extended development sessions, eliminating the need for manual rule reinforcement and reducing developer cognitive load.

## Problem Statement

Stefan experiences significant frustration with AI agents that forget established rules as sessions progress. This creates:
- **Cognitive Load**: Manual review and correction at session end when concentration is depleted
- **Workflow Disruption**: Extra rounds of commits and amendments due to forgotten rules
- **Quality Degradation**: Inconsistent rule application leading to technical debt
- **Time Waste**: Repeated guidance and attention needed for rule compliance

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User (Stefan)
- **Seamless Rule Compliance**: AI agents automatically maintain rule adherence without manual intervention
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No need to monitor and correct rule violations
- **Session Continuity**: Consistent behavior throughout long development sessions
- **Minimal Maintenance**: Self-maintaining rule enforcement system

### Secondary Users (Future Individual Developers)
- **Easy Adoption**: Simple implementation for solo developers
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to individual preferences and workflows
- **Reliable**: Consistent performance across different project types

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (This Increment)
- Complete memory bank structure established
- Solution approach analysis completed
- Decision criteria identified

### Short-term (Next Increment)
- 90% reduction in rule violations during commits
- 100% elimination of memory bank content duplication
- 50% reduction in manual review time

### Long-term (3-6 months)
- Near-zero manual rule enforcement needed
- Consistent rule compliance across all session lengths
- Positive developer experience with AI agent collaboration

## Product Principles

1. **Individual Developer First**: Solutions designed for solo developers, not teams
2. **Minimal Disruption**: Preserve existing workflows while adding reliability
3. **Proven Effectiveness**: Based on observed patterns (re-reading rules works)
4. **Incremental Improvement**: Small, measurable improvements over time
5. **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies or complex infrastructure
