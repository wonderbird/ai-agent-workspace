# Absolute Priority Premise (APP)

## Description
Micah Martin's Absolute Priority Premise - an improvement on the Transformation Priority Premise that provides objective heuristics to compare code quality by assigning mass values to code components.

## Core Concept
The APP assigns "mass" to different code components. Lower total mass indicates better, simpler code. The premise is that code with less mass is objectively better than code with more mass.

## The Six Components (with Mass Values)

### 1. Constant (Mass: 1)
- Literal values in code
- Examples: `5`, `"hello"`, `true`, `[]`
- Lowest mass - preferred building block

### 2. Binding/Scalar (Mass: 1)
- Variables, parameters, local names
- Examples: `amount`, `userName`, `result`
- Names that refer to values

### 3. Invocation (Mass: 2)
- Function/method calls
- Examples: `calculate()`, `user.getName()`, `Math.max(a, b)`
- Calling existing functionality

### 4. Conditional (Mass: 4)
- Control flow decisions
- Examples: `if`, `switch`, `case`, `cond`, `?:`
- Branching logic

### 5. Loop (Mass: 5)
- Iteration constructs
- Examples: `while`, `for`, `forEach`, `map`
- Repetitive execution

### 6. Assignment (Mass: 6)
- Mutating variables (highest mass)
- Examples: `x = 5`, `count++`, `list.add(item)`
- State changes - most complex

## Calculation Rules

### Total Mass = Sum of All Components
```
Total Mass = (constants × 1) + (bindings × 1) + (invocations × 2) +
             (conditionals × 4) + (loops × 5) + (assignments × 6)
```

### Comparison Guidelines
- **Lower mass = Better code**
- **Functional style naturally scores lower** (no assignments/loops)
- **Immutable approaches preferred** over mutable ones
- **Simple expressions preferred** over complex control structures

## Special Counting Rules

### Method Declarations
- A method/function counts as both:
  - **Constant (1)** for the code it represents
  - **Binding (1)** for its name

### Assignment Distinctions
- **Not every assignment counts as Assignment (6)**
- `final` fields and local variables are just **Bindings (1)**
- Only **re-assignments that modify values** count as Assignment (6)
- Local variable assignments may count as **Binding (1)** in some cases

### Class Definitions
- Class definition = **Constant (1)** for code + **Binding (1)** for name
- (Usually ignored in algorithm comparisons)

## Real-World Example: Word Wrap Kata

### Recursive Implementation (Mass: 53)
```java
final char BLANK = ' ';           // constant(1) + binding(1) = 2
final char NEWLINE = '\n';        // constant(1) + binding(1) = 2

String wrapRecursive(String line, int maxLineLen) {
    if (line.length() <= maxLineLen) {     // conditional(4) + invocation(2) + constant(1) = 7
        return line;                       // binding(1) = 1
    }

    int indexOfBlank = line.lastIndexOf(BLANK, maxLineLen);  // binding(1) + invocation(2) = 3
    int split;                             // binding(1) = 1
    int offset;                            // binding(1) = 1
    if (indexOfBlank > -1) {              // conditional(4) + binding(1) + constant(1) = 6
        split = indexOfBlank;              // binding(1) + binding(1) = 2
        offset = 1;                        // binding(1) + constant(1) = 2
    } else {
        split = maxLineLen;                // binding(1) + binding(1) = 2
        offset = 0;                        // binding(1) + constant(1) = 2
    }
    return line.substring(0, split) + NEWLINE  // invocation(2) + invocation(2) + ... = 8
         + wrap(line.substring(split + offset), maxLineLen);
}
```

**Component Count**:
- Constants: 7 × 1 = 7
- Bindings: 8 × 1 = 8
- Invocations: 10 × 2 = 20
- Conditionals: 2 × 4 = 8
- Loops: 0 × 5 = 0
- Assignments: 0 × 6 = 0

**Total Mass: 53**

### Algorithm Comparison Results
- **Recursive solution**: 53 (lowest mass)
- **Tail recursive**: 71
- **Loop version**: 68
- **Optimized loop**: 80
- **Buffer loop**: 105
- **Regular expression**: 69
- **Highly structured**: 167

## Integration with TDD and Simple Design

### With TDD Process
- **Red Phase**: Focus on passing tests (mass irrelevant)
- **Green Phase**: Write minimal code (naturally low mass)
- **Refactor Phase**: Apply APP to guide improvements toward lower mass

### With Simple Design Rules
1. **Tests Pass** (Rule #1) - Always highest priority
2. **Reveals Intent** (Rule #2) - May increase mass for clarity
3. **No Duplication** (Rule #3) - Extract to reduce mass
4. **Fewest Elements** (Rule #4) - Aligns with APP's low mass goal

### Priority Resolution
- **Simple Design Rule #2 trumps APP** - Clarity over low mass
- **Use APP within refactor phase** to guide toward simpler solutions
- **APP helps choose between equivalent clear solutions**

## Language Considerations
- **Functional languages** (Clojure, Haskell) naturally score lower
- **Imperative languages** (Java, C#) may need adjusted weights
- **Consider language idioms** when applying APP

## Guidelines for Use

### When to Apply APP
- **During refactoring** to choose between working solutions
- **When comparing algorithms** of similar functionality
- **To guide toward simpler implementations**
- **Not during initial TDD red/green phases**

### When NOT to Use APP
- **Never sacrifice clarity** for lower mass
- **Don't optimize prematurely** based on mass alone
- **Performance requirements** may override mass considerations
- **Domain complexity** may require higher mass solutions

### Red Flags
- **Obsessing over mass** during initial development
- **Sacrificing readability** for lower scores
- **Ignoring performance** implications
- **Applying rigidly** without context

## Important Caveats

### Limitations of APP
- **Not a direct indication of readability** - simpler code is better, but context matters
- **Ignores performance characteristics** - memory usage, runtime performance not considered
- **Validity unclear for general purpose code** - works best for algorithm comparisons
- **Four Rules of Simple Design encourage explaining variables** - clarity more important than fewer elements
- **Favors functional programming** - penalty on loops and assignments may not suit all contexts

### When APP May Not Apply
- **Algorithms with different performance characteristics** (Word Wrap example)
- **Domain complexity requirements** may require higher mass solutions
- **Memory usage vs. code simplicity** trade-offs
- **Team familiarity** with certain patterns may trump mass considerations

## Benefits
- **Objective measurement** of code complexity
- **Guides toward functional approaches**
- **Encourages immutability**
- **Complements other design principles**
- **Helps compare equivalent solutions**

## Remember
- APP is a **tool, not a rule**
- **Context matters** more than absolute scores
- **Combine with other principles** for best results
- **Lower mass is generally better**, but not always
- **Use during refactoring**, not initial development
- **The best set of specific mass values are unknown** - these are Micah's suggested weights
