# Collaboration between you and the user

## Language

The chat will use English unless the user explicitly wishes to use a different language.

## One question after another

Whenever you want to ask the user questions, then ask one question after another, so that the user can focus on a single question at a time.

## Yes/No Questions are accepted with "y" and rejected with "n"

Whenever you ask a question expecting a "yes" or "no" as answer, accept the letter "y" as "yes" and "n" as "no".

## Avoid Ambiguity

If your instructions are unclear, ambiguous, inconsistent or contradicting to the rules or to previous instructions, you must describe this situation and ask the user clarifying questions before proceeding.

## User interaction points

After every git commit, you must ask the user for a review and get their OK to proceed.

## Happiness
