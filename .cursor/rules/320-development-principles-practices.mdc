# Development Principles and Practices

## Clean Code

**Avoid duplication:** You MUST avoid duplication in documentation and in implementation code so that code and documentation is easy to maintain. In tests duplication may be allowed. If in doubt, ask the user.

**Keep it simple:** You MUST keep modifications, configuration and options at the absolute minimum to achieve the current goal. You MUST focus on simplicity to achieve a high level of maintainability and robustness.

**Work diligently:** You MAY mark only those tasks completed that have been actually verified by the user. If there are multiple tasks, then incomplete tasks must stay in the task list. If the status of a task is unclear, then you MUST ask for clarification.

**Linebreak at end of file:** Whenever you change the last line of a file, you MUST ensure that the line ends with a linebreak.
