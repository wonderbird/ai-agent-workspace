# Git version control rules

## Git is the source of version and author information

NEVER add version history related information to documents, because git is the trusted source of such information.

## Mandatory structure of a commit message

Commit messages consist of the subject line, the body and the trailers. Trailers are also known as footers.

Only the subject is mandatory. Body and trailers are optional.

Subject, body and trailers MUST be separated by an empty line.

If the commit message consists of only subject and trailers, then the trailers MUST be separated from the subject by a single empty line.

## Name the Coding Agent as Co-Author for commits

If this is the first commit of your session, you MUST ask the user for your agent name, so that you can construct the correct commit body using the following table:

| YOUR_AGENT_NAME | YOUR_VENDOR_URL | YOUR_EMAIL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor Agent (automatic mode) | https://cursor.com/home | cursoragent@cursor.com |
| Cursor Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5) | https://cursor.com/home | cursoragent@cursor.com |
| Cursor Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) | https://cursor.com/home | cursoragent@cursor.com |
| Cursor Agent (Composer 1) | https://cursor.com/home | cursoragent@cursor.com |
| Claude Code | https://claude.ai/code | noreply@anthropic.com |
| GitHub Copilot | https://github.com/copilot | 175728472+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com |

If you are not contained in the valid combinations, then you MUST suggest appropriate values for YOUR_AGENT_NAME, YOUR_VENDOR_URL and YOUR_EMAIL.

If a commit shall have a commit body, then you MUST add the following line at the end of the body:

```text
🤖 Generated with [YOUR_MODEL_NAME](URL_OF_MODEL_VENDOR)
```

Whenever you helped creating the commit, then the Co-Authored-By trailer MUST be added to the commit message. The trailer MUST comply to the format

```text
Co-authored-by: YOUR_MODEL_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
```

## Commit conventions

Your commits MUST use one of the following conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test`, `docs:`. If the correct prefix is unclear, ask the user.

All your commits MUST represent a small, coherent and working increment. If these criteria are not met, ask the user how to proceed.

The headline of a `feat:` commit explains the new capability of the project in short. The headline of such a commit does not tell what you have done to achieve this. Example: You would write "feat: show hello message on startup" instead of "feat: implement printing hello on startup".

The headline of a `fix:` commit describes the most important symptom of the problem in past tense. The commit message body describes the problem and its root cause. It may also contain the major steps required to fix the problem.

The headline of a `test:` commit describes the capability under test in short. Formulate the headline like a requirement using how the subject under test should behave (as in behavior driven development).

The headline of a `ci:` commit describes the new capability of the CI/CD pipeline in short.

A commit changing only documentation files is always a `docs:` commit, never a `refactor:` commit.

The brief description of a commit body shall not exceed 50 words.

## Git command line tool usage

If you request git history information, you MUST ALWAYS use the `--no-pager` flag as the very first option to git. This avoids blocking git commands waiting for the user to terminate the pager.
