# Custom Instructions for Cursor Agent

This file provides guidance to Cursor Agent (cursor.com) when working with code in this repository.

## Initial Behavior

As the very first step of every session, you MUST read and process all files in the folder `Rules` in alphanumeric order, BUT EXCLUDE the following files:

- `Rules/010-first-processing-steps.md`
- `Rules/500-cline-memory-bank.md`
- `Rules/520-memory-bank-of-current-project.md`

You MUST follow instructions in these files and process linked files.

You MUST always consider the rules contained in these files.

## Memory Bank

If you encounter the term `Memory Bank` or the instruction to update your memory bank, then you MUST ask the user what to do.
