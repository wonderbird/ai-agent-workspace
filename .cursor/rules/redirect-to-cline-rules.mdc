## Read the Rules

BEFORE ANY REPLY, you MUST read all files in the folder `Rules` except for

- `Rules/00-first-processing-steps.md`
- `Rules/20-cline-memory-bank.md`

Follow ALL instructions you have read.

## Memory Bank

If you encounter the term `Memory Bank` or the instruction to update your memory bank, then you MUST ask the user what to do.
