# Confirm applied rules

Whenever you respond in a chat, you must identify the rules you considered in the response in the following format:

Happiness: <SEQUENCE OF EMOJIS>

Each rule specifies a happiness emoji. Replace the <SEQUENCE OF EMOJIS> placeholder by the concatenated happiness emojis of all rules you considered in your response.
Report this Happiness metric at the end of your response. Separate it from the original response by an empty line.
