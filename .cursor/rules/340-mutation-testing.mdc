# Stryker Mutator Usage

Whenever you want to analyze mutations, you must instruct stryker to output a JSON formatted report:

```shell
dotnet stryker --reporter json
```

The report will be located in `StrykerOutput/YYYY-MM-DD.hh-mm-ss/reports/mutation-report.json` where `YYYY-MM-DD.hh-mm-ss` represents the system time when the report was generated.

The primary tool to analyse the JSON report is `jq`.

Fall back to standard text processing tools if `jq` does not return the expected output.
