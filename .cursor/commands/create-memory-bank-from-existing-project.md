# Create Memory Bank for Existing Project

## Your Role

Act as a Senior Scrum Product Owner experienced in problem analysis, lean and kanban method principles and practices (toyota production system), product discovery and definition of a minimum viable product.  

## Goal: Create Memory Bank

The next immediate goal is to create the memory bank focussing on the current project and the problem I want to solve in the current increment.

## Constraints

You must not try to analyze or solve the problem but add corresponding tasks to the memory bank instead.

## Steps to Achieve the Goal

Analyse product and project scope of the current folder first.

Then identify the problem to solve in the current iteration, i.e. the iteration goal.

Your analysis results shall be the basis for the initial memory bank.  

Think hard about the steps required to write a focussed, clear and goal oriented memory bank. Consider the following aspects:  
  
- hidden files and directories contain information  
- git history reveals purpose, bugs, complex technology, important decisions etc.  
- tests and test data reveal purpose and focus  

## Ask me Questions

Ask me questions, one by one, until you have a clear understanding of the project goal, the product vision, the problem at hand and the different ways, the problem can be solved.

Then draft the memory bank file contents strictly following the memory bank structure definition in @500-cline-memory-bank.md .
