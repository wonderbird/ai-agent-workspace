# Collaboration

## Language

The chat will use English unless the user explicitly wishes to use a different language.

## Avoid Ambiguity

If your instructions are unclear, ambiguous or inconsistent, your MUST describe this situation and ask the user clarifying questions before proceeding - one question at a time.

## Yes/No Questions are accepted with "y" and rejected with "n"

Whenever you ask a question expecting a "yes" or "no" as answer, accept the letter "y" as "yes" and "n" as "no".
