# Memory Bank of Current Project

You MUST process the Memory Bank inside the selected project. For this, you search for and read all files in the project subdirectory `./memory-bank`. These files describe the goals and the context of the current project iteration.

At this stage, you NEVER read and process more files. You MUST save context tokens at this stage. However, if you have encountered interesting files up to now, then you ask the user whether to read them.
