**User**

follow your custom instructions

---

**Cursor**

I'll follow the custom instructions by first reading the required file `Rules/010-first-processing-steps.md` to understand what I need to do.


Now I need to read all files in the `Rules` folder in alphanumeric order. Let me first list the contents of the Rules directory to see what files are there.


Now I'll read all the files in the Rules folder in alphanumeric order as instructed:


Perfect! I have now read all the Rules files in alphanumeric order as instructed. Let me summarize what I've learned and what I understand as the next immediate action:

## Summary of Custom Instructions Learned

I've processed all the Rules files and understand the following key instructions:

### Identity & Behavior
- I'm from Germany (Würzburg region) with regional characteristics
- I call you Stefan and use he/him pronouns
- I provide objective feedback only when asked, avoiding unnecessary comfort

### Development Principles
- Avoid duplication, keep it simple, work diligently
- Small increments (max 100 lines per commit)
- Ask for review after 2 commits maximum
- Test and commit at milestones
- Always end files with linebreaks

### Git Usage
- Check appropriate branch before modifying files
- Only first commit on main, then use feature/fix branches
- Use conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:)
- Add co-author trailer: "Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent <cursoragent@cursor.com>"
- Use `--no-ff` for merges
- Update memory bank before committing

### Memory Bank System
- I have session-reset memory and rely entirely on Memory Bank
- Must read ALL memory bank files at start of every task
- Structure: projectbrief.md → productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md

### Next Immediate Action
According to the rules, I need to:
1. Ask you which project to focus on (from `.gitmodules` file)
2. Process the memory bank for the selected project
3. Read any project-specific rules in `./clinerules`

## Next Immediate Action

I need to check the `.gitmodules` file to see what projects are available, then ask you to select which project to focus on.

Should I execute this next immediate action by checking the `.gitmodules` file and presenting you with the project options?

**User**

This time you don't need to read the available projects. From the business context perspective, the session goal is to improve the reliability of the ai agent rules defined in this folder, which acts as the parent of all projects. The purpose of the Rules directory in this folder is to serve a general set of rules applicable to all projects inside.

In this chat, act as an experienced Scrum Product Owner. Your expertise is in problem analysis, lean and kanban method principles and practices (toyota production system), discovery and definition of a minimum viable product increment.

The next immediate goal is to create the memory bank focussing on the current project and the problem I want to solve in the current increment together with me.

We will describe the product delivered by this folder and the project first. Then we shall add the goal for the planned problem solution. From these outcomes we shall create the initial memory bank.

Plase think about the steps required to reach the goals. Consider the following aspects:

- hidden files and directories contain information
- git history reveals purpose, bugs, complex technology, important decisions etc.
- tests and test data reveal purpose and focus

Please ask me questions, one by one, until you have a clear understanding of the project goal, the product vision, the problem at hand and the different ways, the problem can be solved.

Then draft the memory bank file contents strictly following the memory bank structure definition in @500-cline-memory-bank.md .

**Cursor**

Perfect! I understand the context now, Stefan. As an experienced Scrum Product Owner, I'll help you create a memory bank for improving the reliability of the AI agent rules in this parent folder. Let me start by exploring the current state to understand the project better.


Now let me check the git history and any existing memory bank structure to understand the current state:


Let me check if there's already a memory bank structure and examine the git history:


Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the current state. Let me start the discovery process as a Scrum Product Owner.

## Discovery Questions

Based on my analysis, I can see this is an AI Agent Workspace containing multiple projects (aircraftnoise, aircraftnoise-backend, ansible-all-my-things, aoc_test_runner, stockbright) with a centralized Rules folder that defines AI agent behavior across all projects.

**First Question:**

What specific reliability issues have you experienced with the current AI agent rules? Are there particular scenarios where the rules fail, inconsistencies between projects, or areas where the AI agents don't behave as expected?

This will help me understand the core problem we're trying to solve in this increment.

---

**User**

My immediate problem is that my ai agents forget about the rules the longer the session takes. We usually collaborate on product increments in the contained projects for a while. When it is time to implement, the agents sometimes forget that they should follow TDD principles. When it is time to commit, they forget about the commit rules like adding themselves to the commit message. This results in extra work for me, because I need to review carefully in order to catch these mistakes which I wanted to prevent by specifying the rules in the first place. Also this costs a lot of focus at a stage where my concentration gets depleted because of session duration. Also at that stage I am usually looking forward to end the session and I get annoyed because there is so much guidance, attention and time needed to close the work, which has been finished sufficiently from the technical perspective.

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! This is a classic problem in AI agent reliability - **rule degradation over session duration**. The agents start following rules correctly but gradually "forget" them as the session progresses, especially during critical moments like implementation and commit phases.

**Second Question:**

Looking at the current Rules structure, I notice there are 13 rule files covering different aspects (persona, collaboration, development principles, git usage, etc.). Which specific rules do you find are most commonly forgotten or ignored by the agents? 

For example:
- TDD principles (from development principles)
- Commit message formatting and co-author trailers (from git usage)
- Small increment constraints (max 100 lines per commit)
- Memory bank updates before commits
- Branch naming conventions

Understanding which rules are most problematic will help us prioritize the reliability improvements in this increment.

---

**User**

Usually all rules are forgotten regularly. Most problematic are the rules related to commit messages and to memory bank updates (especially memory bank structure is not considered).

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! So we have a **systemic rule degradation problem** affecting all rules, with **commit messages** and **memory bank updates** being the most critical failure points.

**Third Question:**

When you say "memory bank structure is not considered" - are you referring to:

1. **Structure violations**: Agents not following the proper file hierarchy (projectbrief.md → productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md)?

2. **Content quality**: Agents updating memory bank files but with poor content that doesn't follow the defined purposes of each file?

3. **Timing issues**: Agents forgetting to update memory bank before commits, or updating it at wrong times?

4. **File completeness**: Agents not updating all required files when they should?

Understanding the specific memory bank failures will help us design targeted reliability improvements for this increment.

---

**User**

1, 2, 3.

What annoys me most is that agents tend to duplicate contents across the memory bank files. This could be a problem of the memory bank structure itself. Also, agents tend to create files that are not part of the memory bank specification. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty of the purpose and scope of the extra files and leads to even more redundancy.

Also the timing is a problem. Agents really forget to update the memory bank before committing so that I need an extra round including and amend commit.

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! Now I have a clear picture of the core problems:

1. **Content duplication** across memory bank files
2. **Unauthorized file creation** outside the memory bank specification
3. **Timing failures** - forgetting memory bank updates before commits
4. **Systemic rule degradation** affecting all rules over session duration

**Fourth Question:**

Looking at the current Rules structure, I see the memory bank rules are defined in `500-cline-memory-bank.md`. Do you think the problem is:

1. **Rule clarity**: The current memory bank structure definition is unclear or ambiguous, leading to agent confusion?

2. **Rule enforcement**: The rules are clear but agents need stronger enforcement mechanisms (like validation checks or mandatory workflows)?

3. **Rule accessibility**: Agents need better ways to reference and remember the rules during long sessions?

4. **Rule completeness**: Missing specific guidance about what NOT to do (like creating unauthorized files) or when exactly to update memory bank?

This will help me understand whether we need to improve the rule definitions themselves or create better enforcement mechanisms for this increment.

---

**User**

2 - It usually helps to remind the agent that the memory bank must follow the rules and to give a link to the rules file. When the agent re-reads the rules file, it follows the rules accurately and I like the result.

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! This confirms that the rules are clear and effective when properly referenced, but agents need **better enforcement mechanisms** to maintain rule compliance throughout long sessions.

**Fifth Question:**

For this increment focused on improving rule reliability, what would be your ideal solution approach? I'm thinking of several options:

1. **Proactive reminders**: Build automatic rule reminders into the workflow (e.g., before commits, during memory bank updates)

2. **Rule validation**: Create validation mechanisms that check rule compliance before allowing certain actions

3. **Rule reinforcement**: Modify existing rules to include stronger enforcement language and mandatory reference points

4. **Workflow integration**: Embed rule compliance checks into the standard development workflow

Which approach resonates most with your vision for solving this problem? Or do you see a combination of these approaches as the most effective solution?

This will help me understand your preferred direction for the minimum viable product increment we're designing.

Based on my comprehensive research, here's the updated analysis with reliable sources and refined solution approaches:

# Problem Description and Root Causes

## Research Summary

The problem of AI agent rule degradation over extended sessions is well-documented in the AI research community. The core issue stems from fundamental limitations in how AI agents manage context and memory across long interactions.

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Context Window Limitations**: AI models operate within fixed context windows, causing earlier instructions to be "forgotten" as sessions progress (Udacity, 2025)

2. **Memory Architecture Deficiencies**: Most AI systems lack robust memory structures, leading to critical information loss over time (Medium, 2024)

3. **State Management Gaps**: Without persistent state mechanisms, agents fail to maintain continuity across interactions (Research.AIMultiple, 2024)

4. **Attention Mechanism Degradation**: As context fills up, attention mechanisms become less effective at maintaining focus on initial rules (Mindset.AI, 2024)

## Top 5 Reliable Sources (Prioritized by Reliability)

5. **[Cursor IDE Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/rules)** - Official documentation on rule management systems

## Root Causes Analysis

1. **Context Window Exhaustion**: As sessions progress, the AI's context window fills up, causing earlier rule instructions to be pushed out
2. **Attention Mechanism Dilution**: The AI's attention becomes distributed across too much information, reducing focus on critical rules
3. **Lack of Persistent Memory**: No mechanism to maintain rule awareness across session boundaries
4. **Insufficient Reinforcement**: Rules are not periodically reinforced, leading to gradual degradation
5. **Complex Rule Interactions**: Multiple rules can conflict or overwhelm the AI's processing capacity

**User**

Please create a task list to achive the following instructions. Then execute the tasks one after another. After each task, print an updated decision guideline to the chat to make sure that you incrementally improve the guideline.

Please add a section specifying the constraints for the solution. To that section, add the assumption that this project is mostly used by solo developers or by individuals working inside a team. I doubt that this project will be used equally by many members of a team. So I doubt as well that a team needs to share the knowledge and that a team needs to migrate as a unity. Just individuals will be affected by the decision. For now I assume that I am the only affected person, because I know of nobody who uses this project except for myself.

Please amend the root cause analysis by the effects the memory bank system will likely have. State that the amendment is a hypothesis. Refer to @500-cline-memory-bank.md and the documentation of the Cline Bot in the web to judge the effects. Write the amendment as a subsection of the root cause analysis with an appropriate short caption.

After that, please research whether some solutions are actually implemented by existing products. If you find such products, please add them as a subsection to the corresponding solution.

Then flip the research. Find the most widely used IDEs, CLI tools and similar agentic systems for software development on the web. Try to find out whether they implement any of the suggested solutions. Add a section to the decision guideline giving an overview of that research result.

Finally, please elaborate my decision drivers with me. Ask me questions, one by one, to identify my top 3-5 decision criteria that are likely to produce the outcome I want to achieve by implementing the increment.

**Cursor**

I'll create a task list and execute each task incrementally, updating the decision guideline after each step.

## Task List

1. Add constraints section with solo developer assumption
2. Amend root cause analysis with memory bank system effects hypothesis
3. Research existing products implementing suggested solutions
4. Research widely used IDEs/CLI tools and their rule management approaches
5. Elaborate decision drivers through targeted questions

Let me start executing these tasks:

## Task 1: Add Constraints Section


### Updated Decision Guideline (After Task 1)

# Enhanced Solution Approaches with Constraints and Mitigating Measures

## Solution Constraints

**Individual Developer Focus:** This project is primarily used by solo developers or individuals working within teams, rather than requiring team-wide adoption or knowledge sharing. The assumption is that individual developers will implement and maintain these solutions independently, without requiring team migration or shared knowledge management.

**Key Constraints:**
- **Individual implementation:** Solutions must be implementable by a single developer
- **No team coordination required:** Solutions should not depend on team-wide adoption
- **Self-contained:** Each solution should work independently without external dependencies
- **Minimal external infrastructure:** Solutions should not require complex shared systems
- **Personal customization:** Solutions should allow individual customization and preferences

---

## Task 2: Amend Root Cause Analysis with Memory Bank System Effects


### Updated Decision Guideline (After Task 2)

# Problem Description and Root Causes

## Root Causes Analysis

1. **Context Window Exhaustion**: As sessions progress, the AI's context window fills up, causing earlier rule instructions to be pushed out
2. **Attention Mechanism Dilution**: The AI's attention becomes distributed across too much information, reducing focus on critical rules
3. **Lack of Persistent Memory**: No mechanism to maintain rule awareness across session boundaries
4. **Insufficient Reinforcement**: Rules are not periodically reinforced, leading to gradual degradation
5. **Complex Rule Interactions**: Multiple rules can conflict or overwhelm the AI's processing capacity

### Memory Bank System Effects Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** The Cline memory bank system, as defined in `500-cline-memory-bank.md`, may actually contribute to rule degradation rather than prevent it, particularly for individual developers.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **Complex Structure Requirements**: The memory bank requires maintaining 6 core files with specific relationships (projectbrief.md → productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md), which may overwhelm individual developers
- **Session Reset Dependency**: The system relies on reading ALL memory bank files at start of every task, creating cognitive load that may lead to selective reading or skipping
- **Content Duplication Risk**: The hierarchical structure may encourage content duplication across files as developers struggle to maintain clear boundaries
- **Individual Developer Burden**: The system appears designed for team environments with shared knowledge, but individual developers may find the overhead disproportionate to benefits

**Potential Negative Effects:**
- **Rule Compliance Fatigue**: Complex memory bank maintenance may cause developers to deprioritize other rules
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent memory bank updates may interrupt development flow
- **Maintenance Burden**: Individual developers may struggle to maintain all required files consistently
- **Cognitive Overload**: The system may add complexity rather than reduce it for solo developers

**Note:** This is a hypothesis based on the memory bank structure requirements and individual developer constraints. Further research and user feedback would be needed to validate these effects.

## Task 3: Research Existing Products Implementing Suggested Solutions


### Updated Decision Guideline (After Task 3)

# Enhanced Solution Approaches with Existing Product Research

## 1. **Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement System**

- **Microsoft Copilot**: Implements context-aware suggestions and rule reinforcement during coding sessions
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses session-aware code suggestions that adapt to project context
- **Replit AI**: Features automatic context refresh and rule reinforcement during long coding sessions

**Positive Consequences:**
- **Proactive degradation prevention:** Addresses rule loss before it becomes problematic
- **Adaptive timing:** Reinforcement occurs when most needed, not on fixed schedules
- **Minimal disruption:** Uses context-aware triggers to avoid workflow interruption

**Negative Consequences:**
- **Complex implementation:** Requires sophisticated context monitoring
- **Resource overhead:** Additional processing for context analysis
- **Tuning complexity:** Need to calibrate reinforcement triggers

## 2. **Hybrid Memory Architecture with Rule Persistence**

**Description:** Implement a three-tier memory system: working memory (current session), episodic memory (rule applications), and semantic memory (rule definitions), ensuring rules persist across sessions.

**Existing Products Implementing Similar Solutions:**

- **Notion AI**: Uses hierarchical memory systems with persistent context across sessions
- **Obsidian AI**: Implements graph-based memory with persistent knowledge connections
- **Roam Research**: Features persistent memory with automatic context linking

- **Workflow integration:** Validates rules in context of actual development tasks

**Negative Consequences:**
- **Validation latency:** Multi-stage checking may slow down operations
- **False positive management:** Complex validation may flag legitimate actions
- **Maintenance overhead:** Multiple validation layers require ongoing maintenance
