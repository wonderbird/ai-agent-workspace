# 001: AI Agent Rule Adherence Strategy

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-10-10

## Context and Problem Statement

AI agents exhibit rule degradation over extended development sessions. As session context grows, agents tend to "forget" foundational rules, particularly during critical phases like implementation (e.g., TDD principles) and version control (e.g., commit message formatting, memory bank updates). This leads to inconsistent quality, workflow disruptions, and increased cognitive load for the developer who must manually review and correct these lapses.

The root causes stem from fundamental limitations in current AI architecture:
- **Context Window Exhaustion**: Earlier instructions are pushed out of the model's limited context window.
- **Attention Dilution**: The agent's focus gets distributed across too many tokens, weakening the signal of the original rules.
- **Lack of Persistent Memory**: Agents are stateless and do not retain memory of rules across sessions without external mechanisms.

This architectural decision record (ADR) explores potential solutions to ensure AI agents reliably adhere to predefined rules throughout their operational lifecycle.

## Decision Drivers

The selection of a solution will be guided by the following key principles, prioritized for a solo developer workflow:

- üöÄ **Rapid Implementation**: The solution must be simple enough to implement and provide value in under two weeks.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Low Maintenance Overhead**: Once configured, the solution should require minimal ongoing tuning, management, or manual intervention.
- üßò **Minimal Workflow Disruption**: The solution should integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow without imposing blocking interruptions or significant friction.

## Considered Options

1.  **Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement**: A system that intelligently reminds the agent of the rules at opportune moments (e.g., based on session duration or specific triggers like `git commit`).
2.  **Hybrid Memory Architecture**: A more complex, persistent memory system that gives the agent long-term knowledge of the rules, separate from its working (session) memory.
3.  **Intelligent Rule Validation Pipeline**: A system that validates the agent's output (e.g., a commit message) against the rules and blocks non-compliant actions, often integrated with pre-commit hooks.
4.  **AI-Assisted Memory Bank Enforcement**: A specialized validation system that uses semantic analysis to enforce the structure and content quality of the project's memory bank.
5.  **Session-Aware Workflow Integration**: A deeply integrated system that embeds rule compliance checks into the natural development workflow, adapting to the developer's patterns.
6.  **Do Nothing (Accept the Status Quo)**: Make no changes and continue with the current manual review and correction process.
7.  **Structured Manual Workarounds**: Formalize manual processes like re-pasting rules or using checklists to improve compliance.
8.  **Buy a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Product**: Research and purchase an existing product that solves the problem.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** This decision is pending. The purpose of this document is to evaluate the considered options against the defined decision drivers to facilitate a well-informed choice.

## Pros and Cons of the Considered Options

### 1. Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement

- **Description**: This approach focuses on reminding the agent of the rules at the right time. The trigger can be simple (e.g., every N commits) or more intelligent (e.g., detecting signs of deviation).
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Aligns perfectly with all decision drivers: fast to implement, non-disruptive, and low maintenance.
    - ‚úÖ Directly addresses the "forgetting" problem by refreshing the agent's context.
    - ‚úÖ Can be implemented incrementally, starting with a very simple MVP.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå May not prevent 100% of violations if the timing of the reminder isn't perfect.
    - ‚ùå A naive implementation could become noisy if not tuned correctly.
- **Mitigations**:
    - To improve accuracy, the simple reminder can be combined with a lightweight, non-blocking validation check for critical tasks.
    - To reduce noise, the system can use adaptive timing for reminders based on session complexity or allow the developer to tune the frequency.

### 2. Hybrid Memory Architecture

- **Description**: This involves building a long-term memory for the agent where rules are permanently stored and retrieved, separate from the chat history.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Offers a robust, long-term solution to rule persistence.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates **Rapid Implementation**: Requires significant architectural work.
    - ‚ùå Violates **Low Maintenance**: Such a system would be complex to build and maintain.
    - ‚ùå Could be overkill for a solo developer context.
- **Mitigations**:
    - The implementation complexity can be reduced by starting with a simple key-value store and focusing the MVP on storing only the most critical rules.
    - Using existing libraries (e.g., LangChain memory modules) can abstract away some of the maintenance burden.

### 3. Intelligent Rule Validation Pipeline

- **Description**: This system acts as a gatekeeper, validating the agent's outputs against rules before an action (like a commit) is completed.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Provides the strongest guarantee of rule compliance.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates **Minimal Disruption**: Inherently blocking and can cause workflow friction.
    - ‚ùå Violates **Rapid Implementation**: Building a reliable and non-annoying validation pipeline is complex.
    - ‚ùå Can lead to "fighting the linter" scenarios, which is a poor user experience.
- **Mitigations**:
    - To minimize disruption, the pipeline can be configured to be non-blocking by default, showing warnings instead of errors for most violations.
    - The user experience can be improved by providing clear, actionable feedback and allowing developers to easily disable specific rules.

### 4. AI-Assisted Memory Bank Enforcement

- **Description**: A specialized version of the validation pipeline focused solely on ensuring the memory bank's integrity.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Solves a specific, high-pain point (memory bank content duplication and structure).
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Shares the same "disruption" and "complexity" cons as the general validation pipeline.
    - ‚ùå Only solves part of the problem, as it doesn't address rule-breaking in other areas like commit messages.
- **Mitigations**:
    - To reduce disruption, this can be implemented as a background process that provides suggestions rather than a blocking pre-commit hook.
    - The limited scope can be addressed by integrating it as one component of a larger, more comprehensive solution.

### 5. Session-Aware Workflow Integration

- **Description**: The most advanced option, where rule awareness is woven deeply into the IDE and development process.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Potentially offers the most seamless and intelligent user experience.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates all three decision drivers: it is extremely complex, slow to implement, and would require significant maintenance. This is a large-scale project, not a targeted solution.
- **Mitigations**:
    - The complexity can be managed by scoping the MVP down to a single, small integration point (e.g., providing rule hints in the IDE for `.md` files).
    - The system can be built as a series of independent micro-tools rather than a monolithic system to reduce the maintenance burden.

### 6. Do Nothing (Accept the Status Quo)

- **Description**: This option involves making no changes to the current workflow. The developer continues to manually monitor the AI agent's output, provide reminders, and correct mistakes as they occur.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ **Zero Implementation Effort**: Requires no time or resources to implement, making it the cheapest option in the short term.
    - ‚úÖ **No Workflow Disruption**: The existing workflow is maintained without introducing new tools or processes that could cause friction.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå **No Improvement**: The core problem of rule degradation remains unaddressed, leading to continued frustration and wasted time.
    - ‚ùå **High Cognitive Load**: Places a constant burden on the developer to act as the "rule enforcer," especially at the end of sessions when focus is low.
    - ‚ùå **Inconsistent Quality**: The quality of the output will continue to vary depending on the agent's state and the developer's diligence in catching errors.
    - ‚ùå **Higher Long-Term Cost**: The cumulative time spent on manual correction and rework will likely exceed the up-front investment of an automated solution.
- **Mitigations**:
    - By definition, this option has no mitigations, as implementing them would mean choosing a different option. The negative consequences are inherent to this choice.

### 7. Structured Manual Workarounds

- **Description**: This option formalizes the manual processes the developer can use to improve AI agent compliance. It relies on the developer's discipline rather than automated enforcement and includes techniques like systematically re-pasting rules before critical tasks or using manual checklists.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ **No Implementation Cost**: Requires no coding or setup.
    - ‚úÖ **High Flexibility**: The developer can choose which workarounds to apply and when, adapting to the specific situation.
    - ‚úÖ **Can be Effective**: With discipline, these methods can significantly improve the agent's adherence to rules.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå **Shifts Burden to User**: This approach makes the developer responsible for remembering and executing the workarounds, which is the very problem the project aims to solve.
    - ‚ùå **High Cognitive Load**: It replaces the cognitive load of "reviewing and correcting" with that of "remembering and applying workarounds."
    - ‚ùå **Inconsistent and Error-Prone**: The effectiveness depends entirely on the developer's consistency. Forgetting to apply a workaround leads back to the original problem.
    - ‚ùå **Does Not Scale**: This is not a sustainable long-term solution and does not address the root cause of AI rule degradation.
- **Mitigations**:
    - The cognitive load and error rate can be reduced by using templates, editor snippets, and physical checklists to make the workarounds easier to apply.

### 8. Buy a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Product

- **Description**: This option involves researching and purchasing an existing commercial product that provides AI agent management, rule enforcement, or a similar capability.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ **Potential for Rapid Solution**: If a suitable product exists, it could be faster than building a custom solution.
    - ‚úÖ **Leverages External Expertise**: A commercial product would be built and maintained by a dedicated team, saving internal development and maintenance effort.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå **Market Unlikely to Exist for Solo Developers**: The market for this specific problem (a solo developer managing their AI agent's rules) is likely nonexistent. Products in this space are typically enterprise-focused and expensive.
    - ‚ùå **High Cost**: Commercial AI solutions often involve subscription fees that may not be justifiable for a solo developer.
    - ‚ùå **Lack of Customization**: A commercial product may not be flexible enough to integrate with a highly customized workflow.
    - ‚ùå **No Obvious Candidates**: A preliminary search reveals no ready-to-buy products that solve this specific problem for an individual developer.
- **Mitigations**:
    - The lack of a direct solution can be mitigated by exploring adjacent markets (e.g., developer productivity tools) or open-source alternatives.
    - High costs and lack of customization can be addressed by using a free trial to thoroughly evaluate the product's flexibility before purchase.
