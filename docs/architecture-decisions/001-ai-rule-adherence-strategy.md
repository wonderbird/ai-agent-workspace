# 001: AI Agent Rule Adherence Strategy

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-10-10

## Context and Problem Statement

AI agents exhibit rule degradation over extended development sessions. As session context grows, agents tend to "forget" foundational rules, particularly during critical phases like implementation (e.g., TDD principles) and version control (e.g., commit message formatting, memory bank updates). This leads to inconsistent quality, workflow disruptions, and increased cognitive load for the developer who must manually review and correct these lapses.

The root causes stem from fundamental limitations in current AI architecture:
- **Context Window Exhaustion**: Earlier instructions are pushed out of the model's limited context window.
- **Attention Dilution**: The agent's focus gets distributed across too many tokens, weakening the signal of the original rules.
- **Lack of Persistent Memory**: Agents are stateless and do not retain memory of rules across sessions without external mechanisms.

This architectural decision record (ADR) explores potential solutions to ensure AI agents reliably adhere to predefined rules throughout their operational lifecycle.

## Decision Drivers

The selection of a solution will be guided by the following key principles, prioritized for a solo developer workflow:

- üöÄ **Rapid Implementation**: The solution must be simple enough to implement and provide value in under two weeks.
- üßò **Minimal Workflow Disruption**: The solution should integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow without imposing blocking interruptions or significant friction.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Low Maintenance Overhead**: Once configured, the solution should require minimal ongoing tuning, management, or manual intervention.

## Considered Options

1.  **Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement**: A system that intelligently reminds the agent of the rules at opportune moments (e.g., based on session duration or specific triggers like `git commit`).
2.  **Hybrid Memory Architecture**: A more complex, persistent memory system that gives the agent long-term knowledge of the rules, separate from its working (session) memory.
3.  **Intelligent Rule Validation Pipeline**: A system that validates the agent's output (e.g., a commit message) against the rules and blocks non-compliant actions, often integrated with pre-commit hooks.
4.  **AI-Assisted Memory Bank Enforcement**: A specialized validation system that uses semantic analysis to enforce the structure and content quality of the project's memory bank.
5.  **Session-Aware Workflow Integration**: A deeply integrated system that embeds rule compliance checks into the natural development workflow, adapting to the developer's patterns.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** This decision is pending. The purpose of this document is to evaluate the considered options against the defined decision drivers to facilitate a well-informed choice.

## Pros and Cons of the Considered Options

### 1. Context-Aware Rule Reinforcement

- **Description**: This approach focuses on reminding the agent of the rules at the right time. The trigger can be simple (e.g., every N commits) or more intelligent (e.g., detecting signs of deviation).
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Aligns perfectly with all decision drivers: fast to implement, non-disruptive, and low maintenance.
    - ‚úÖ Directly addresses the "forgetting" problem by refreshing the agent's context.
    - ‚úÖ Can be implemented incrementally, starting with a very simple MVP.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå May not prevent 100% of violations if the timing of the reminder isn't perfect.
    - ‚ùå A naive implementation could become noisy if not tuned correctly.

### 2. Hybrid Memory Architecture

- **Description**: This involves building a long-term memory for the agent where rules are permanently stored and retrieved, separate from the chat history.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Offers a robust, long-term solution to rule persistence.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates **Rapid Implementation**: Requires significant architectural work.
    - ‚ùå Violates **Low Maintenance**: Such a system would be complex to build and maintain.
    - ‚ùå Could be overkill for a solo developer context.

### 3. Intelligent Rule Validation Pipeline

- **Description**: This system acts as a gatekeeper, validating the agent's outputs against rules before an action (like a commit) is completed.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Provides the strongest guarantee of rule compliance.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates **Minimal Disruption**: Inherently blocking and can cause workflow friction.
    - ‚ùå Violates **Rapid Implementation**: Building a reliable and non-annoying validation pipeline is complex.
    - ‚ùå Can lead to "fighting the linter" scenarios, which is a poor user experience.

### 4. AI-Assisted Memory Bank Enforcement

- **Description**: A specialized version of the validation pipeline focused solely on ensuring the memory bank's integrity.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Solves a specific, high-pain point (memory bank content duplication and structure).
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Shares the same "disruption" and "complexity" cons as the general validation pipeline.
    - ‚ùå Only solves part of the problem, as it doesn't address rule-breaking in other areas like commit messages.

### 5. Session-Aware Workflow Integration

- **Description**: The most advanced option, where rule awareness is woven deeply into the IDE and development process.
- **Pros**:
    - ‚úÖ Potentially offers the most seamless and intelligent user experience.
- **Cons**:
    - ‚ùå Violates all three decision drivers: it is extremely complex, slow to implement, and would require significant maintenance. This is a large-scale project, not a targeted solution.
